A 100% client-side, single-file HTML tool for securely managing the online parts of an air-gapped XRP transaction workflow. This tool allows you to fetch account information and broadcast a signed transaction to the XRP Ledger without ever exposing your private keys to an online machine.

---

## Security-First Philosophy

This tool was built with a "paranoid" mindset, prioritizing security and transparency above all else.

*   **100% Client-Side:** All operations happen directly in your web browser. No data, keys, or transaction information is ever sent to any server, except for the final, signed transaction blob which is broadcast directly to the public XRP Ledger nodes.
*   **Works Completely Offline:** The tool is a single HTML file with no external dependencies. You can download it and run it on a completely air-gapped computer to generate QR codes from signed transaction data.
*   **Fully Auditable:** The entire source code is contained within a single, human-readable file. There are no hidden packages or compiled code. What you see is what you get.


## Cross-Platform Compatibility

As a self-contained HTML application, the XRP Airgap Bridge runs on any modern device with a standards-compliant web browser.

*   **Desktop:** Windows, macOS (Intel), macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux
*   **Android, iPhone, iPad :** Android OS, iOS / iPadOS
*   **Other devices:** E.g. Chromebook, Raspberry Pi, etc.
*   **Supported Browsers:** Works on all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Brave.

### Requirements

*   **JavaScript must be enabled** in your browser for the tool to function.
*   For QR code scanning features, you must **grant the browser permission** to access your device's camera when prompted.

### Online & Offline Capabilities

The `index.html` file and its local `js` folder are designed to be fully portable. You can download the repository and run the tool on a completely air-gapped machine for maximum security.

**Functions available OFFLINE:**
*   ✅ **Generate QR Code**
*   ✅ **Regenerate QR Code**

**Functions that require an INTERNET connection:**
*   ❌ **Fetch Account Info**
*   ❌ **Submit Signed TX**


## Key Features

*   **Fetch Account Info:** Safely get your account's current `Sequence` number and a suggested `LastLedgerSequence` from the live network to prepare for an offline transaction.
*   **Submit Signed Transaction:** Broadcast a signed transaction blob (pasted or scanned via QR code) to the XRP Ledger.
*   **Generate QR Code:** A general-purpose utility to create a QR code from any text or data, useful for moving a signed transaction blob from an offline machine.
*   **Regenerate QR Code:** A robust "lifesaver" utility that can decode blurry, low-quality, or difficult-to-read QR codes and regenerate them as clean, scannable images.

## How to Use: The Air-Gapped Workflow

This tool acts as the secure online interface for your offline cold wallet.

#### Step 1: On Your **Online** Machine

1.  Open the `XRP-Airgap-Bridge.html` file.
2.  Go to the **"Fetch Account Info"** tab.
3.  Enter your public XRP address (`r...`) and click "Fetch Account Info".
4.  Securely transfer the `Sequence` and `LastLedgerSequence` numbers to your offline machine (e.g., by writing them down).

#### Step 2: On Your **Offline** (Air-Gapped) Machine

1.  Using your preferred offline wallet software, construct your transaction (e.g., a payment with destination, amount, etc.).
2.  Use the `Sequence` and `LastLedgerSequence` you just transferred.
3.  Sign the transaction with your private key. This will produce a long hexadecimal string (the "signed transaction blob").
4.  (Optional if you dont have ability to turn your signed transaction blob with your wallet) Use a copy of this tool on your offline machine to turn the long transaction blob into a QR code using the "Generate QR" tab.

#### Step 3: Back on Your **Online** Machine

1.  Go to the **"Submit Signed TX"** tab.
2.  Either paste the hexadecimal blob directly into the text box or click **"Scan Signed TX QR"** to use your camera.
3.  Verify the network selection and click **"Submit Transaction"**.
4.  The tool will broadcast your transaction to the XRP Ledger and show you the final response.
